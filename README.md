# Torrent Stats

A simple Python script (`torrent_stats.py`) that takes a `.torrent` file as input and queries its trackers (HTTP/HTTPS only) to retrieve statistics like the number of seeders and leechers.

## Usage

```bash
python torrent_stats.py <path_to_torrent_file.torrent>
```

## Development Notes

This project was developed entirely using AI tools:

*   **[aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider):** An AI pair programming tool used for code generation and modification.
*   **[Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/):** The underlying language model providing the coding intelligence. Released on my birthday!

I didn't write any code in this repo; human involvement was limited to providing prompts, reviewing the generated code, and performing linting/formatting.
